			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>For my Formal Research Project, I hope to shed light on the roles of communication, technology and research in my discipline – mechanical engineering. By doing so, I seek to aid those making the transition into tertiary education by being a guide, to prepare the young talents on their road towards becoming a participating member in mechanical engineering. Firstly, I will analyze how communication plays in part in this academic profession. How knowledge and data is conveyed by engineers to fellow peers and to the general public, as well as differentiate between scholarly journals and trade journals. Besides that, I will discuss about research. How engineers carry out studies, the steps and rules that they follow, together with the necessary mindset while conducting experiments. Finally, I will examine how technology contributes to this field of work and vice versa. I will try to open the reader’s eyes to the relevance of both aspects, which come hand in hand. All in all, by the end of the paper, the student would have gained a basic insight about these few aspects of mechanical engineering, and with any luck, be more prepared as an individual as they delve deeper into their careers and education in this discipline.</p>
