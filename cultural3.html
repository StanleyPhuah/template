			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>To put things into perspective, I chose a cultural artifact that relates to this pandemic that is running rampant throughout our nation - a music video, titled accordingly. Written by the band The Lonely Island, this song features the likes of Adam Levine and Kendrick Lamar. The Lonely Island is a comedy group, best known for their comedic music. The title and lyrics of the song reference the popular motto and internet meme YOLO, a phrase dating back to the early 1900s and highly popularised by the artiste, Drake and famous MC, Rick Ross on such songs as "The Motto", which were intended to promote a mixtape originally titled YOLO (Roberts) (Shapiro). The phrase has since become a cultural phenomenon and has been reworked to be an excuse for irresponsible and outlandish behavior (Jonathan). The single parodies the phrase, and reworks the phrase to mean something else. The song's lyrics interpret "You Only Live Once" to mean the complete opposite of dangerous and irresponsible behavior, and to instead be over secured and protective of life, in a pessimistic viewpoint. While the music video portrays the definition of the word in completely different viewpoint, they are shining light on the culture of the current generation of young people who are wasting away their lives carrying out stunts that are risky, unpredictable, and sometimes even just plain stupid. It is a jab to how the juveniles of today are living their lives. By satirically mocking this pop cultural phenomenon, the core message they are trying to present is how saddening the situation truly is.</p>
