			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Things are born, they live, they die. The inevitability seems scary, yet it is the cog that runs the world. Without mortality, there would be no advancement, only stagnation. Yet, while life is so short and precious, for the youth of today, YOLO seems to carry an entirely different definition. What those of old would have interpreted as the sacred essence of life, now is used as a basis, an excuse for foolish and ignorant behavior. This slang seems to have turned into the battle cry of shallow-minded teens who waste away their years in a drunken stupor or blazed out of their minds, defending their actions by claiming that life should be enjoyed, to party and have fun since we only get one shot at it. The phrase has undergone so much degradation that now, the mere use of YOLO induces disgust and regret. It is also spreading like wildfire on social medias. Used as hash tags or in comments, it has become the go to excuse for bad decisions and unwise actions. With the rise of social media, YOLO has gained even more notoriety. It is especially disheartening to see all the tumblr, facebook, and twitter posts that contain some degradation of this phrase, such as "Gunna go get sooo drunk LOL YOLO" on a fifteen year old girl's status (Knoll). And recently, it was on the news that Ervin McKinness, a 21-year-old aspiring rapper, tweeted about driving drunk at 120 mph minutes before dying in a fiery one-car crash that killed the rapper and four others (Sieczkowski). For a moment of thrill, a whirr of excitement, lives were lost. It is actions like these that have turned this phrase from something of such depth and meaningfulness into one that is so hollow and empty, its original meaning so muddled and lost, all that is left a shell of what it could be.</p>
