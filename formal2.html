			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Since the dawn of civilization, the question of existence has been part and parcel of life. Why are we alive? What is our role, our purpose? These burning, inexplicably unanswered questions are the basis for religions and cults. Yet, despite being a miniscule part of a boundless entity, we are still a cog, a gear that has its purpose and role to fulfill in the great machine that is our Earth. That is how human have progressed. How the first Homo sapiens that roamed the deserts have evolved into the tie-wearing businessmen of the twenty-first century. Civilizations rose and fell through the span of human history, yet never once did progress stall. It trudged on through tough times and flourished and blossomed through eras of great prosperity. And, every being, every soul, be it living or dead, each had and has a role in shaping the world into becoming the one in which we live in today. From those in power to the slaves bounded by ropes and chains, each had their place and purpose. 
Today, we are no closer to figuring out the true meaning of existence. Yet, time rolls on and each generation bears the burden of its predecessors to be the force that runs the world before passing the baton to the next crop of talents. For our current generation, we are equipped since a young age, molded and prepared for this task. Since pre-school, up till we graduate into the working world, we are prepared as best to help play our part in whichever career path we decide upon. Unfortunately, for many students, the leap from high school to university is one that is fraught with new challenges and experiences. Many are still raw, unsure about what the future holds. Hence through this project, I aim to guide my fellow peers through this phase by introducing them to the expectations of writing, reading and researching in my discipline â€“ mechanical engineering in the hope of helping them understand the ways that literacies are used to create and communication in engineering.
