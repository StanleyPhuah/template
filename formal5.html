			<h1>Technology in Mechanical Engineering</h1>
			<p>	When it comes to research in this discipline, it is the core, the root of engineering. Without research, there will be no development and innovation. Research in engineering is systematic, as it is bound to steps and rules that are commonly adhered to. The basics of how engineering research is similar to scientific research. Firstly, engineers make observations. They determine issues that require their expertise. Then, they form a hypothesis, an inductive and reasoned guess. Scientists use their knowledge of past events to develop a general principle or explanation to help predict future events. The general principle is called a hypothesis (The Experimental Method). Engineers will then perform an experiment. We design an experiment based on our prediction (The Experimental Method). Next, we analyze the results of the experiment. From our analysis of the experiment, we have two possible outcomes: the results agree with the prediction or they disagree with the prediction (The Experimental Method). Through that, we draw our conclusion and report the results by publishing their findings in scholarly journals and books. This way, their knowledge is shared and can be further studied and improved. This is how research in engineering is carried out and is the foundation of much of the breakthroughs in this discipline. </p>
			<p>For example, in a research conducted by a team headed by Andrew L. Zydney, they studied the impact of undergraduate research experience in engineering. The study found out that by research experience leaves an obvious impact on the career of engineers. Alumni with research reported significantly greater enhancement of important cognitive and personal skills, including the ability to speak effectively, understand scientific findings, know literature of merit in the field, analyze literature clearly, and possess clear career goals (Zydney). This is indicative that research is a key aspect in engineering. From their research, we also see the how a research is carried out using the experimental method. Firstly, they observed the issue regarding research experience in engineering. Then, they hypothesized that by having prior research skills, it will greatly benefit the undergraduates in their personal self as well as future career. Next, they planned their experiment. They created a survey to collect data to form the basis of their study. The alumni survey asked respondents to reflect upon a large set of questions about their undergraduate experience (Zydney). They survey was administered to a total of 2,444 alumni from the graduating class of 1982 through 1997 (Zydney). The next step was to analyze the collected results. Through their analysis, they confirmed that research plays a significant part in shaping the career and growth of undergraduates pursuing engineering. With that, they drew a conclusion and published their paper. </p>
