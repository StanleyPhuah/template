			<h1>Communication in Engineering</h1>
			<p>In both academia and industry, communication plays a big part in engineering. Engineers speak and write their ideas. Engineers also work individually or in groups to write proposal and reports (Communicating as an Engineer). One form of communication as engineers is through the publication of scholarly articles in journals. Scholarly or peer-reviewed journals have collections of articles written by experts in academic or professional fields. Their intended audience is other scholars and professionals. Journals are excellent for finding out what has been studied or researched on a topic and to find bibliographies that point to other relevant sources of information (What is a scholarly journal?). The authors are often experts in their field. In the articles that I have read, most have immense credentials and are respected figures in the field. For example, William D. Siuru, the author of one of the articles that I studied, “The Vanguard of Electric Vehicles,” has published many successful books in his field of study. He is also a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, which is a professional association with over 130,000 members in 158 countries worldwide. Besides that, I also interviewed a lecturer of mine, Dr. Dahsin Liu. He is currently teaching in Michigan State University. He graduated with a Naval Architecture Degree in the National Taiwan Ocean University in 1976, then furthered his education and earned his masters and PhD degree in Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. He has also written extensively about his research, most recently, about impact response of woven composites with small weavings. </p>
			<p>Besides that, when engineers communicate through their written work, they often rely on visual interpretation to efficiently present their data. They use tables, graphs and diagrams to make the report clear and comprehensible. For instance, the author uses a table to compare the different types of battery cells and its performance. By placing each data set side by side, the performance of each battery can easily be analyzed and compared. Engineers also rely on footnotes to ensure that readers have a clear understanding of what he is trying to convey. In this case, the author includes footnotes under the data tables that explain the terms that were abbreviated in the texts. This is to allow ease of reference to aid readers new or unfamiliar to the topic. Another tool in the arsenal is by using a graph. In this case, the author uses a bar chart to compute the relationship between perceived benefits of research experience to the number of semesters involved in research.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, engineers also rely on technical drawings to explain certain aspects of their research. With each involved parts labeled, the readers will be able to visualize the process that is being related by the author. In this instance, he uses the engineering drawing to explain the feasibility of using an ac motor and two-speed automatic transaxle contained in the same housing and operating on the same axis.</p>
			<p>When communicating through a scholarly article, the language is often very technical. The language includes specialized terms and the jargon of the discipline (What is a scholarly journal?). In these articles, we find terms that are simplified, such as EV and ICE, and words such as transistorized power inverter, indicating that he assumes that the readers have basic knowledge concerning the subject matter prior to reading the paper, as the target audience is often scholars or other professionals.</p>
			<p>One reason that scholarly journal is one of the most basic and important ways engineers communicate is because in order to be considered a scholarly work, it has to first be peer-reviewed. This means the content of the piece has went through rigorous screening and verification by fellow experts and the research is credible, as it has been referred. Their work is also always cited in the form of footnotes or bibliography. This ensures that the readers can refer to the source for clarification and adds to the credibility of the piece. </p>
			<p>Another form of written communication as engineers comes in the form of trade journals. Also known as professional magazines, it is published with the intention of target marketing to a specific industry or type of trade. The writers are often professionals in the field however are the work they submit for release on this platform is not peer-reviewed. They usually write for-profit corporations. For example, one of the trade articles that I reviewed is written for Electronic Design, a United States print magazine. </p>
			<p>The writers also speak in a general language, shying away from specialized language to fit the comprehension of the general audience. The use of tables, graphs and other tools are also rare as more focus is put towards capturing the focus of the reader. For example, in an article that I analyzed, titled,  “All-Electric Vehicles Prepare to Shock the Automotive Market,” it uses bolded, capitalized title to immediately attract the attention of the reader. Besides that, it has an attractive print format, with many pictures of different models incorporated to give the audience a visual feel for the cars that he is promoting. It also contains advertisements by other companies marketing its product.</p>
			<p>One issue regarding trade journals is that it is usually not peer-reviewed. More often than not, the work is will not be cited as well. This is because it is an outlet for opinions and the writers have no carried out actual experiments regarding the subject matter. Hence, the information should always be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
			<p>Other than presenting their ideas through written form, engineers also communicate their ideas verbally. By giving presentations or holding talks, they express their vision to their fellow peers and the public. For mechanical engineering, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers holds numerous technical conferences, where the brightest minds share their work with the their colleagues and the general population. It is a hub for fresh ideas and upcoming projects by engineers who are ready to make an impact on the world. </p>
