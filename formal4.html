			<h1>Communication in Engineering</h1>
			<p>In both academia and industry, communication plays a big part in engineering. Engineers speak and write their ideas. Engineers also work individually or in groups to write proposal and reports (Communicating as an Engineer). One form of communication as engineers is through the publication of scholarly articles in journals. Scholarly or peer-reviewed journals have collections of articles written by experts in academic or professional fields. Their intended audience is other scholars and professionals. Journals are excellent for finding out what has been studied or researched on a topic and to find bibliographies that point to other relevant sources of information (What is a scholarly journal?). The authors are often experts in their field. In the articles that I have read, most have immense credentials and are respected figures in the field. For example, William D. Siuru, the author of one of the articles that I studied, “The Vanguard of Electric Vehicles,” has published many successful books in his field of study. He is also a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, which is a professional association with over 130,000 members in 158 countries worldwide. Besides that, I also interviewed a lecturer of mine, Dr. Dahsin Liu. He is currently teaching in Michigan State University. He graduated with a Naval Architecture Degree in the National Taiwan Ocean University in 1976, then furthered his education and earned his masters and PhD degree in Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. He has also written extensively about his research, most recently, about impact response of woven composites with small weavings. </p>
			<p>Besides that, when engineers communicate through their written work, they often rely on visual interpretation to efficiently present their data. They use tables, graphs and diagrams to make the report clear and comprehensible. For instance, the author uses a table to compare the different types of battery cells and its performance. By placing each data set side by side, the performance of each battery can easily be analyzed and compared. Engineers also rely on footnotes to ensure that readers have a clear understanding of what he is trying to convey. In this case, the author includes footnotes under the data tables that explain the terms that were abbreviated in the texts. This is to allow ease of reference to aid readers new or unfamiliar to the topic. Another tool in the arsenal is by using a graph. In this case, the author uses a bar chart to compute the relationship between perceived benefits of research experience to the number of semesters involved in research.</p>
