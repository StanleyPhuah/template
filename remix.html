		<p>Composing in Context</p>
		<p>For this project, my team decided to shine light on the issue that is the high prices of textbooks. We felt that it was a problem that affects most students on campus. To highlight the issue, we decided to create a documentary to show how much a student actually fork out each semester on books as well as find out studentsâ€™ opinion on the subject matter. As it was a documentary, we decided that it should be presented in a serious tone. Through making the video, I realized that it is an actual predicament that many students suffer. Few of the obstacles we encountered were getting the bookstores to agree to an interview with us. As most of them declined our requests, we decided to interview students to get their opinion instead as our target audience is students who we hope can relate with our video on a personal level.</p>
