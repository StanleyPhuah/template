		<p>Composing in Context</p>
		<p>For this project, my team decided to shine light on the issue that is the high prices of textbooks. We felt that it was a problem that affects most students on campus. To highlight the issue, we decided to create a documentary to show how much a student actually fork out each semester on books as well as find out students’ opinion on the subject matter. As it was a documentary, we decided that it should be presented in a serious tone. Through making the video, I realized that it is an actual predicament that many students suffer. Few of the obstacles we encountered were getting the bookstores to agree to an interview with us. As most of them declined our requests, we decided to interview students to get their opinion instead as our target audience is students who we hope can relate with our video on a personal level.</p>
		<p>Process</p>
		<p>The reason we decided to highlight the issue regarding the prices of textbook was because one of our group members just happened to buy a textbook online for the upcoming semester. He spent upwards of a hundred dollars for a used textbook and was frustrated as it burned a hole in his pocket. The most challenging part is trying to engage the audience. We wanted to capture the attention of the viewers yet at the same time needed to make sure that the essence of the subject was effectively presented. Another barrier we faced in the project is the constraints of time as well as team management. In the end however, we managed to come together as a team and carry out each person’s duty. For the entire project, we did take the systematic approach. We planned the proposal, divided the workload, carried out our roles and finally compiled our video.</p>
		<p>Research</p>
		<p>Most of the resources that we used were from the Internet. Through sites such as Amazon, we used the prices of textbook from these websites as a comparison to the prices charged by the local bookstores. YouTube was another tool that was essential for us as we studied several documentaries to mimic their design in the hope of creating a documentary, which was able to effectively convey the message that we were presenting.</p>
		<p>Collaboration</p>
		<p>This project was the only group project for the course, Writing: Science and Technology. My group consisted of four members – Aaron Wilson, William Adler, Grant Puckett as well as myself, Zhi Hong Phuah. Corporation was key in making this project a success. Unfortunately, as we only had one class per week, it was difficult to set a specific time for everyone to meet up. At the same time, due to personal issues, our work was severely. Fortunately, we were able to interact and communicate online. Through the Internet, we shared ideas and worked on the video. I believe that having a group helps for the project as the load of the project can be distributed as creating the video is not a walk in the park. However, I also found out that when working in groups, it needs a voice and a leader. For this project, I took charge and decided to be that person to motivate and spur my group members on. This project served as a great learning curve. It opened my eyes to the importance of teamwork, corporation, leadership as well as time management.</p>
		<p>Project Management</p>
		<p>To be honest, we did not plan the project particularly well. This is due to several members of the group who were missing class and were inactive online. Another stumbling block was that one of our group members fell ill and was hospitalized, which further delayed the completion of our project. If I were to do it over again or had more time, I would definitely be more assertive in pushing my team to start the project much earlier before the deadline. Even though we managed to pull through as a group and finish our project, it definitely was a rush against time and I believe that if we had a week head start, it could the avoid the last minute rush and the final video could have turned out even better.</p>
		<p>Documentary Design</p>
		<p>The general design of our documentary was to explain the issue at hand, relate it to our audience and finally give our solution. We came up with the general outline of the video by viewing different documentaries online and decided to mimic how they present and communicate with their viewers. As our core message was to underline the issue of the high prices of textbooks, we decided to have a serious tone to show a sense of seriousness regarding the subject. First, we gave a general summary of the issue. Then, in an effort to show how much a student actually pays for textbook each semester, one of our group mates, William Adler will actually purchase the textbooks that he needs for the upcoming term. Through this, we seek to help our viewers relate to the matter. We also conducted interviews and through the discussions with students, we relay the frustrations of students who are going through the same problem and prove that it is a topic that is in need to be made aware of. Finally, we wrap up the documentary with our final thoughts and expectations. </p>
