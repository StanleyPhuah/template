			<p>While scientists are widely renowned for groundbreaking research, it is the humble engineer that puts this knowledge into building functioning products to help better human life. Engineers apply the principles of science and mathematics to develop economical solutions to technical problems. Their work is the link between scientific discoveries and the commercial applications that meet societal and consumer needs (Engineers - What They Do). Throughout the span of human advancement, it is the engineers who have developed new products by pushing the boundaries of technology. While it lacks the glitz and glamour of other professions, their contribution to shaping our world today is undeniable. From air travel to smart phones, much of what is taken for granted today is owed to the work of these people, who relentlessly design, test and develop new innovations. </p>
