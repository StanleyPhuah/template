		<h1>The Simple Black Box</h1>
		<p>	Growing up, everyone has his or her goals and aspirations. Some dream of becoming astronauts, 
		doctors. Yet, no matter the distinction between their choices, one way or another, these ambitions 
		stemmed from somewhere. Some influenced by their parents, others by their idols and sometimes, even by 
		technology.</p>
		<p>I have always been intrigued by how things work, how things in daily life that we take for granted 
		function and evolve. Furthermore, as a generation living in this technological era, I grew up surrounded
		by technology. Computers, Smart phones, Play Stations, all these were part and parcel of my 
		adolescent years. Yet, among all the different machines, what stirred my curiosity the most as a 
		young boy was watching the characters on the television screen. They were lifeless, yet, so full of 
		life. How? How can these images on the screen move and dance? Where did they come from? And, with a 
		click of a button, the screen goes dim, and everything dissipates into nothingness. </p>
		<p>Once, as I switched on the television, a face came flying towards me. In shock, I screamed, tripped
		backwards and sat there, grounded to the spot. As tears streamed down my face, my dad raced over and 
		picked up my tiny body, comforting me, assuring me that the creature behind the screen would not 
		harm me and is not real. As my tears subsided, anxiety turned to curiosity. I started pestering my 
		father, inquiring about how something that seemed so real could in fact just be an image on a screen.
		Try as he may though, my young mind was not ready for the technical jargons as well as the mechanical 
		aspect of how they worked. Despite his efforts, I merely stared blankly at him, clueless to his 
		explanations. However, it triggered something in me, it inexplicably left an unanswered question 
		within me that I was determined to find the solution to. </p>
		<p>Since then, technology in everyday life seemed wondrous to me, from radios to cars, I wanted to 
		know how they worked, how they came to be. These inventions, who and what drove them to be created? 
		And with innovation, there are no bounds to what these inventions can achieve. At the same time, I 
		found my love for inventing. I loved to create, to put together random pieces of different objects 
		to make a new one, how different parts of a device sync and work in harmony, yet each has its own 
		purpose to serve. In class, while my classmates were burying their head in books, taking down notes 
		furiously, I would be disassembling and reassembling my pen, feeling very much like and engineer. 
		It was hard for me to focus on lectures. I hated class, everything felt too rigid to me, there was
		no room for imagination and growth. I had these different ideas yet nowhere to express them. 
		However, there was one class that that served as an outlet for these pent-up ideas – living skills
		class. This class was where I was able to get hands on experience in building models and simple 
		devices, where it was not just swallowing facts and regurgitating them in the exams. For the class’s
		final project, we were required to create a display case. As the materials lay before me, my 
		creative juices flowed. Idea after idea seemed to stream through my thoughts. It was a labor of 
		love that took a month for the entire project to finally be completed. As I put on the finishing 
		touches, I stared at the final design. I did not know what struck my chord that day when I decided
		to design my display case in the form of a television. It had perspex glass as it’s screen and
		every bit else was inspired by it. I felt that its concept of viewing something inanimate through
		the perspex was similar to watching the projections on the television screen. It seems the 
		television had left a far greater effect in my life than I previously have imagined. Admiring 
		the final outcome, I felt a sense of achievement tingle down my spine. From the design phase to 
		its completion, every step was fulfilling. And, that love for inventing was the hunger that led 
		me to my career choice - mechanical engineering. </p>
		<p>I want to create, to build things that can inspire awe in people from all walks of live, to 
		engineer machines that can change and better human life. At the same time, I want to understand 
		the mechanics behind them, how they function. For that, I knew I had to buck up, because as an 
		engineer, the learning aspect was just as important as the practical side of the job. I 
		straightened myself out, and started taking my studies more seriously. As much I still 
		dreaded the mundane lectures and bland subjects, I began to find joy through understanding the
		knowledge that was being passed on. To the point where, I found myself growing mentally as a 
		person as well as an engineer.</p>
		<p>Recently, while browsing through the channels, I came across that particular movie in which the 
		monster scared me as a little kid. A sense of nostalgia dawned on me, as I could not help but 
		chuckle as I imagined the young me, frightened by this fictional creature. Amidst reminiscing about
		the past, I realized that the television has come a long way since its humble beginnings, from the
		black and white films to the High Definition videos of today. From that simple black box back in 
		my old home to this flat screen television that presently hangs in the living room. Along with that
		and my age, the programs I watch may have evolved, but its role has varied little. From the cartoons
		that made me laugh and jump as a kid, the television series which I followed intently every week as 
		a teenager, to the news and documentaries that supplemented my hunger for knowledge. Each transition,
		each phase, the television played a role in my growth through the years. Up until today, the 
		television is still my source of knowledge, my source of enjoyment as well as the source of what
		gave rise to my dream. </p>
		<p>As I pursue my career, I am now exposed to physics, statics, thermodynamics and other engineering
		subjects. Gradually, but surely, as my level of education increases, many of these technologies no 
		longer seem to work as if by magic, in its place numbers and equations which governs each and every 
		of its actions. While I no longer am perplexed by how these machines function, it has not taken away
		the sense of amazement I have for these inanimate objects. As I look back to the innocent boy that 
		once was dumbfounded as my dad explained the mechanics of how the television worked, completely 
		clueless about the words he uttered, I am glad that my inquisitive nature did not waver even though 
		I never did understand despite his best efforts. Now, as I work towards my engineering degree, I am
		thankful that the simple black box helped me find my passion and gave me a career path that I know 
		that will benefit not just myself, but hopefully others in the future as well. And maybe one day, 
		I too may create a piece of technology that will impact someone’s life as much as the television 
		has left on mine.</p>
