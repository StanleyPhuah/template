			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>YOLO. You only live once. These four words are the basis of humanity. The cycle of life that inevitably leads to one thing. Death. We live, we exist, at the end of it all, we dissipate into nothingness. For centuries, the rich and powerful sought to eradicate mortality. They were chained to their earthly belongings, slaves to their possessions, so much so that losing them was their greatest fear. Needless to say, they longed for immortality. There are legends of such beings, those who have found the “cure” to death, and reached superiority to us mortals (NasiaThePerson). In Ancient Greece there was a pair of twins, one named Castor and one named Polydeuces (NasiaThePerson). They are often called Dioskouri, meaning sons of Zeus, or Gemini. Sons of Zeus, the Greek god of thunder and the skies, and of the mortal Queen Leda, Polydeuces was immortal while Castor was not (NasiaThePerson). When Castor was dying, Polydeuces gave half of his immortality to his brother so that they may live alternating from the Underworld to Earth (NasiaThePerson). Another legend is that of the first emperor of China, Shih Huang Ti. Driven mad by power, he could not bear the thought of death. Ordering his ministers to create a mystical medicine that would grant him immortality, he tried everything and anything rumored to be able to increase his longevity. Led to believe that mercury was the cure to mortality, he consumed large amounts of it, which ultimately caused his death. As centuries rolled past, technology has advanced leap and bounds. With cures and remedies, life no longer seems as fragile as it used to be. While the Black Death may be a thing of the past, now, there is a new disease, one that is spreading, plaguing our youth, infecting our teenagers – the YOLO epidemic.</p>
