                        <h1>Blog 1</h1>
                        <p>Today's class was very interesting. We watched a video about Oral Robert's homosexual grandson.Through
                        his poetry and his voice, we hear his sadness, his bitterness. He expresses
                        his struggles about his sexuality and how he wishes his gay uncle, Uncle Ronnie, had the strength to be proud
                        of who he was, instead of taking his own life as an escape. Personally, I
                        feel that every person, no matter straight, gay or bisexual, no one should be discriminated
                        because of their sexual preference. This video also shows how much society has changed, how we
                        are more accepting of people who are different compared to how things were decades ago. Yet,
                        I still feel that it took great courage by Oral Robert's grandson to publicly state his sexuality, to
                        proudly come out of the closet instead of hiding and being ashamed of who he was.
                        </p>

                        <p>I had to come up with an object that relates to my academic discipline. Immediately, I knew what
                        I was going to write about. Growing up I was so intrigued by the television - how it worked, how it functioned.
                        I was glad I actually had an object that inspired me to pursue mechanical engineering. Hence, it was a simple
                        task of putting my ideas into words. I hope that I can effectively present my passion for engineering as well as 
                        relate how the television triggered my love for technology and drove my inquisitive nature.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Blog 3</h1>
                        <p>Today, we watched the South Park episode, Make Love, Not Warcraft. I had watched the
                        episode before but as a huge South Park fan, I was still excited to rewatch the episode. 
                        This episode was about how the South Park cast spent all their time on a game, trying to level up in their quest
                        to kill the person that slayed their character in Warcraft. While it is a funny episode, it also highlights
                        how some of the teenagers of today allow games to control and even take over their lives. This led me to think
                        about the amount of time that I put into video games. I believe moderation is key. Video games are definitely beneficial
                        as long as we do not play excessively. It also serves as an introduction to the Cultural Analysis Project, where we tie 
                        a social issue to an artifact. In this case, the South Park episode relates to the social issue of our generation
                        hooked on video games.

                        <h1>Blog 4</h1>
                        <p>I'm having trouble deciding an interesting enough topic to talk about for my Cultural Analysis 
                        Project. I want to talk about something that is relatable and relevant to our current generation, yet thought-provoking 
                        and captivating to the readers. In the end, I decided to address the YOLO issue, whereby teenagers are committing acts of utter
                        recklessness and stupidity, and defending those actions by the mere rationale that we only live once.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Blog 5</h1>
                        <p>We start work on our Formal Research Project. It is tough for me to explain how the communication, technology and research is 
                        conducted in mechanical engineering as I am still raw to these aspects of the engineering discipline. It took me much research
                        online to gather enough information to write the paper. I also emailed my ME 222 about an interview, hopefully he will agree to it. At the same time, I pray that my paper will turn out alright.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Blog 6</h1>
                        <p>I have been in Iowa for the entire week to represent my country for an indoor soccer tournament. Despite doing well for 
                        the soccer tournament, it has set me behind on my Formal Research Project. During the car ride back from Iowa, I spent most of it
                        trying to finish the paper. Unfortunately, my phone does not have hotspot service. Completing the paper without internet services posed 
                        an issue but I managed to finish it nonetheless.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Blog 7</h1>
                        <p>In class, I showed my research paper to Dr. Christie. To my dismay, it turned out my entire format was wrong. I did not 
                        separate each aspect that I was supposed to write about individually. Instead, I combined each section and wrote them as a whole. 
                        As i began to panic, Dr. Christie surprised me by giving me and extension. I was so relieved and thankful about how understanding she was. I plan
                        to begin work on reformatting the paper once i get back to my place.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Blog 8</h1>
                        <p>The Chrysler Eminem Super Bowl Commercial is one that is very well-made. It shows the struggles that Detroit have been through, the hardship it
                        faced. It pairs it with Eminem, how he came from the hood, the roughest parts of town, yet he made it by becoming an international superstar. This relates to how the commercial 
                        markets the new Chrysler car, saying that Detroit is not giving up, and they will show that they too can come out from this slump. The voice over is also very powerful. The images incorporated throughout the video also 
                        captures the attention of the viewers. The tone of the commercial is sombre yet inspiring as it seeks to send a message of perseverance and never giving up, which I feel it succeeds in each aspect.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Blog 9</h1>
                        <p>Today, I met with my groupmates in class for the Multimodal Remix Project. Our idea is to make a documentary 
                        regarding the issue about the exuberant costs for textbooks. Every semester it burns a hole in the pockets of students. We feel this is on the shoulders 
                        of bookstores as well as publishers. It adds so much burden on students financially. Hopefully, we can shine light on this issue and maybe open people's eyes to this problem.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Blog 10</h1>
                        <p>Time to get some footage! Our group decided to make a video regarding the high prices of texbooks. Hence, I made trips to each bookstore to 
                        get footage to be used in the video. And, as I was walking to the Spartan Bookstore to film some footage, I realised the sun setting. It was such a 
                        beautiful sight and I immediately started taking videos of the scene. After hours of travelling and filming, I am pretty sure I have enough 
                        shots to make a proper video.
                        </p>

                        <p>I am so glad that iMovie is so simple to learn.  
                        My groupmates also managed to interview students on their opinions about the issue of the high prices of textbooks. I started by writing a script, recorded voice overs, and compiled and cut the video from the different footages that I collected. It took 
                        sometime, but I finally completed the video! As I watched the uploaded video on YouTube, a sense of achievement dawned on me. I was 
                        proud of my work. Maybe I should be a YouTuber. Then again, I sound weird on video, maybe not.

                        <p>Starting work on Codeacademy, I realised how much work I've put off. Fortunately I have prior knowledge on computer science. It helped 
                        me breeze through the basic sections. However, it still is so tedious and time-consuming. No one to blame but myself for keeping my work 
                        to the last minute. This will serve as a reminder to not pile my work until the deadline. 
                        </p>

                        <p>Today, we start work on our final paper. How time flew. From the first project to the final one, everything 
                        seemed to pass in a blink of an eye. As I wrote my draft that we were supposed to turn on the day itself, I looked around class, everyone were furiously typing away. 
                        I was glad that i took the class, but I felt I should have made more effort in trying to get to know more people in class. Throughout the semester, I only made three friends in class. I'll make sure 
                        next semester I will try harder to interact with my fellow classmates.
                        </p>

                        <p>Last class of the semester! As I sit with my group for the final project. I can't believe that the semester is coming to an end. It has been a hectic yet
                        eventful semester. However, the week ahead of us will be rough. Finals are coming, projects will be due. Time for excessive energy drinks and coffee. And in two weeks, I'll be heading home for the summer. So many things 
                        to look forward to. Time to soldier on through the dreaded finals week. 
                        </p>

                        <p>FINAL BLOG ENTRY! As I am working on the Course Retrospective Project, I reflect on how much I have grown through the semester. This course have been one that 
                        is about self-reflection, yet at the same time self-advancement. I have no regrets taking this class. I have learned so much. From making my own portfolio, giving myself the affirmation that
                        I am pursuing the right field, and finally discovering so, so much more about myself.
