                        <p>Today's class was very interesting. We watched a video about Oral Robert's homosexual grandson.Through
                        his poetry and his voice, we hear his sadness, his bitterness. He expresses
                        his struggles about his sexuality and how he wishes his gay uncle, Uncle Ronnie, had the strength to be proud
                        of who he was, instead of taking his own life as an escape. Personally, I
                        feel that every person, no matter straight, gay or bisexual, no one should be discriminated
                        because of their sexual preference. This video also shows how much society has changed, how we
                        are more accepting of people who are different compared to how things were decades ago. Yet,
                        I still feel that it took great courage by Oral Robert's grandson to publicly state his sexuality, to
                        proudly come out of the closet instead of hiding and being ashamed of who he was.

                        <p>Today, we watched the South Park episode, Make Love, Not Warcraft. I have watched this
                        episode before but as a huge South Park fan, I was still excited to rewatch the episode. 
                        This episode was about how the South Park cast spent all their time on a game, trying to level up in their quest
                        to kill the person that slayed their character in Warcraft. While it was a funny episode, it also highlights
                        how some of the teenagers of today allow games to control and even take over their lives. This led me to think
                        about the amount of time that I put into video games. I believe moderation is key, it is definitely beneficial
                        as long as we do not play excessively. It also an introduction to the Cultural Analysis Project, where we tie 
                        a social issue to an artifact. In this case, the South Park episode relates to the social issue of our generation
                        hooked on video games.
