                        <p>Today's class was very interesting. We watched a video about Oral Robert's homosexual grandson.Through
                        his poetry and his voice, we hear his sadness, his bitterness. He expresses
                        his struggles about his sexuality and how he wishes his gay uncle, Uncle Ronnie, had the strength to be proud
                        of who he was, instead of taking his own life as an escape. Personally, I
                        feel that every person, no matter straight, gay or bisexual, no one should be discriminated
                        because of their sexual preferences. This video also shows how much society has changed, how we
                        are more accepting of people who are different compared to how things were decades ago. Yet,
                        I still feel that it took courage by Oral Robert's grandson to publicly state his sexuality, to
                        proudly come out of the closet instead of hiding and being ashamed of who he was.
