			<h1>Research in Mechanical Engineering</h1>
			<p>In this field, technology and mechanical engineering comes hand in hand. Technology is the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a pre-existing solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. And, the goal as engineers is to push the limits of technology. Thus, by developing technology, engineers can achieve even greater objectives. Technology has also played an important factor in helping in conducting research. New equipment and tools enable engineers to carry out new tests and studies, which leads to greater milestones in the field.</p>
			<p>As a case in point, in our pursuit of progress, with it, inevitably has spawned issues. One of the cases of this is pollution. With industrialization, along with it came harm to our environment. From automotive to factories, the emissions have caused once clear skies and blue waters to be infected by harmful pollutants. Hence as an engineer in this day and age, I see the duty I play in restoring our lands to its once pristine conditions. Therefore, I decided to study an article about an invention that can help in our fight for a greener Earth - electric vehicles. Through the article, “The Vanguard of Electric Vehicles,” we learn engineers are developing new technology, making changes in the hope of bettering the world. Yet, at the same time, it is also technology that propels the engineers. Without existing technology, engineers would not have the tools to carry out the experiments to test the efficiency of the new batteries that are being invented. It is apparent that both technology and engineering complement one another. Using existing technology, engineers expand their horizons to achieve even greater technological success. </p>
			<p>Through my interview with Dr Dahsin Liu, he also highlights the importance of technology in the engineering world. When he was working on his research regarding effects on energy absorption of Arched Composites, he was working on a new composite of higher strength and durability. To test his material’s strength, he relied heavily on tensile machines that gave him the necessary data in order to justify his research, machines which are the products birthed by technological advancements. </p>
