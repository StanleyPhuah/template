			<h1>Research in Mechanical Engineering</h1>
			<p>In this field, technology and mechanical engineering comes hand in hand. Technology is the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a pre-existing solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. And, the goal as engineers is to push the limits of technology. Thus, by developing technology, engineers can achieve even greater objectives. Technology has also played an important factor in helping in conducting research. New equipment and tools enable engineers to carry out new tests and studies, which leads to greater milestones in the field.</p>
			<p>Through my interview with Dr Dahsin Liu, he also highlights the importance of technology in the engineering world. When he was working on his research regarding effects on energy absorption of Arched Composites, he was working on a new composite of higher strength and durability. To test his materialâ€™s strength, he relied heavily on tensile machines that gave him the necessary data in order to justify his research, machines which are the products birthed by technological advancements. </p>
