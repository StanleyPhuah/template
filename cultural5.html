			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>You only live once. There is no doubt in that. Which is exactly why the current situation has to be remedied. To me, the one way for this issue to be resolved is for the youth of today to truly understand and appreciate what the phrase actually conveys. Instead of a gateway, a platform for engaging in doltish impulses, the teenagers have to realize that it is an urge, a motivation to pursue their dreams and goals. It is a spark to propel ourselves to chase the aspirations that we seek to achieve. It also means carpe diem, the aphorism that advises us to seize the day. To seek out new experiences, to try new things, explore new horizons, and to open up our hearts and soul to the boundless adventures that await our future. This however does not justify exposing ourselves to hazardous activities. Instead, it pushes us to not allow ourselves to be chained down by self-doubt and self-pity, to not hide away when hardship dawns upon us. We only live once. The choice is in our own hands, our destiny within our own palms. Whether we choose to live, or to merely exist, to make a difference, or to leave this Earth with nothing to show for. Everyone plays a part in this, teachers, parents, we ourselves, each one has the power to open our eyes to what the world has to offer. Teachers, by enlightening their students about the wonders of life through education. Parents, by pointing their sons and daughters on to the right path. Yet, at the end of it all, whether or not we are up to the challenge is upon ourselves. Whether to step up to what the world has to offer, to give that one chance, one life we have been granted and turn it into something worthwhile, or to cover in fear, wasting away the days, waiting for death to come knocking. Either way, the final destination does not change. That, we do not have the power to alter. However, we can determine how we arrive at deaths door. To leave this Earth, knowing that you made a change, be it little or large, or to lie on deathâ€™s bed, regretting all the squandered opportunities that you let slip by. Hence, better yet, instead of holding on to the motto, you only live once, realize that you too only die once. Know that time fleets by without regards to who and what happens. Take charge of your life and believe in your own ability.  </p>
