		<h1>Multimodal Remix Project</h1>
		<p>Writing has always been tough for me. Growing up in Malaysia, a multiracial country, I was required to learn three different languages. As such, I have never particularly excelled at composition. Hence, when I enrolled in my First-Year Writing class, Writing: Science and Technology, I prepared myself for the worst. Yet, now, as the semester comes to a close, I have no regrets, in fact I am thankful that I took the course. Throughout the entire term, students were exposed to many different aspects of writing through four different projects. Each project was unique yet related as it carries on certain aspects from one to the other. </p>
		<p>The first assignment was the Lived Experiences Project. We had to identify a technology that had impacted our career choice. For this project, it required us to reflect on what triggered our love, our passion for pursuing our chosen discipline. For me, my interest in technology stemmed from childhood. From the first time I saw the inanimate characters dance and move on the television screen, I was intrigued, fascinated, so much so that it prompted my choice in the field of mechanical engineering. The challenge was to tie this piece of object to the academic field we have chosen. During this project, through reminiscing about my past, it made it clear to me that I am on the right path and have made the correct decision in choosing to study mechanical engineering. As for students who are struggling to pin point a career track that is right for them, this assignment presents an opportunity for them to look within themselves and hopefully help set them on the correct path.</p>
		<p>Next, we were introduced to the Cultural Analysis Project. While the first project’s focus was on us, ourselves, this one has it sights on society. With the same concept in mind, we tie a cultural artifact to a social issue. This was interesting, as it required much brainstorming and effort as we had to observe and understand not just the issue at hand, but at the same time recognize the relationship between the object and the problem. I decided upon the issue concerning the You Only Live Once mentality, which was spreading like wildfire within our youth. Plagued by this flawed thinking, many of our generation’s teenagers commit acts of utter recklessness and stupidity, justifying it with the merely rationale that we only live once. The issue is especially gaining traction and blowing up as of late as it is plastered across all the different social medias. I tie the issue to the music video, YOLO, by The Lonely Island. As I engaged myself in the assignment, I began to scrutinize and dissect the issue, which brought out an analytical side that I never knew was within me. On top of that, part of the requirement of the proposal was to come up with solutions for the subject issue. This put my critical thinking skills to the test, as I had to ponder upon the issue to devise effective ways of tackling the matter. </p>
		<p>Following that was the Formal Research Report. This project required us to introduce how communication, writing and research are carried out in our chosen discipline. This project is a stark contrast to the previous two, as it does not require personal opinion, whereas required us to carry out research, compile the data and present it effectively. It presented us with an opportunity to learn how to utilize research tools such as online resources from the Internet as well as written journals. We learned how to narrow down our research online by using key words. By funneling and filtering out the unwanted articles, we were able to pick out appropriate and quality journals that aided us in completing our work. At the same time, we began to grasp the difference between scholarly journal and trade journal. Among other things, one of the requirements of the report was to conduct an interview with a person who teaches major courses and or research in that discipline, as well as another who practices in a field related to that major. I decided to interview my lecturer who teaches Mechanics of Deformable Solids as well as my uncle who works in Western Digital. This activity gave me a chance to gain insights into the work of professionals in engineering and at the same time, train my communication skills.  Furthermore, through this research paper, it opened my eyes to the ways literacies, both technological and rhetorical, are used to create and communicate knowledge in mechanical engineering. I also learned the proper way to construct a research paper. This is especially essential as an engineering student as it is the method in which engineers present their research and findings. In a way, I grew not just as a writer, but as an engineer as well. Unfortunately, for this project, I feel like I did not execute as well as I hoped. The reason for this is because I rushed into the project without having a complete understanding of the material. Hence, one tip I have for getting good grades on this paper is to first fully prepare and familiarize oneself with the research data before starting work on it</p>
		<p>Finally, the fourth and last project was the Multimodal Remix Project. This was the assignment that I enjoyed the most. It consists of two parts. For the first segment, we were divided into groups. And, as a team, we had to work together to create a documentary based on one of the earlier projects by someone in the group. My team decided to base our video on a Cultural Analysis Project, which addressed the issue regarding the high-prices of textbook. In our view, it is a social topic that most Michigan State student could relate to. Through our video, we seek to shine light on the issue in the hope that bookstores as well as publishers heed our pleas and realize that the exorbitant price tags which they charge for textbooks is adding financial burden on the shoulders of us students. This project, despite it being the toughest to execute, as I have zero prior knowledge to filmmaking, was the one that brought me the most self-satisfaction as well as personal growth. Working in a team, I realized the importance of cooperation and communication within an organization. Due to personal issues, our work got severely delayed. As the deadline came close, I took it upon myself to motivate and push my teammates to ensure the completion of our video. That unexpectedly sparked the leadership qualities within me. After gathering the required footage, I began compiling the video. After learning how to navigate iMovie through YouTube videos, I spent hour after grueling hour sifting through the recorded videos to find the right parts for our film. It drained every ounce of my energy, but in the end, our short documentary came to fruition. As I watched my finished work, I was utterly proud. All the effort that I put into it was justified as I felt a sense of achievement dawned upon me. As for the second part of the project, we had to submit a reflective memo that thoroughly explains and analyses the choices we made to revise our work and the effects those choices had on achieving our purpose. All in all, through this project, not only did I pick up skills that can assist me in the future, it brought out qualities that would have been dormant within me otherwise. I found out that I could be a leader and work well with others. Furthermore, I learned to be assertive and proactive, as most things in life do not come served on a silver platter. These aptitudes are those that I will seek to develop further throughout my academic life. </p>
		<p>From the surface, the objective of the course is to help students develop the necessary writing skills to prepare them for tertiary education. Yet, Writing: Science and Technology does not just help improve a student’s writing capabilities, far from it. Through the projects, we dig deep within ourselves to reflect on personal strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, it promotes individual growth in terms of mental and skill development. Skills such as coding, researching, making documentaries, these new abilities that will serve the students well no matter their major. Personally, I also believe that it has honed my skills as a writer. I have learned how to analyze, think critically, carry out research and present my opinion effectively. Not only that, this First-Year Writing class serves as a platform to discover or reaffirm our career choices. As for those who are raw and undecided, they will find out their passions, their affinities to different aspects, which may lead them to a discipline of their liking. For me, it made it clear to me that mechanical engineering is a profession that I truly love, and I am on the right academic track. In a nutshell, I highly recommend this course to anyone planning to enroll as it is not just a writing class, but also one of self-realization, development and affirmation.</p>
